# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project trains a machine learning model to predict diabetes using a logistic regression algorithm. The model is trained on the `diabetes.csv` dataset and saved using `pickle`. 

## Files
- "diabetes.csv": Dataset containing features and target variable.
- "diabetes_model.pkl": Saved trained model.
- "predict_diabetes.py": Script to load the model and make predictions.
